        "content": "Herman Melville, an American author best known today for his novel Moby Dick, was actually more popular during his lifetime for some of his other works. He traveled extensively and used the knowledge gained during his travels as the basis for his early novels. In 1837, 5  at the age of eighteen, Melville signed as a cabin boy on a merchant ship that was to sail from his Massachusetts home to Liverpool, England. His experiences on this trip served as a basis for the novel Redburn (1849). In 1841 Melville set out on a whaling ship headed for the South Seas. After jumping ship in Tahiti, he wandered around the 10 islands of Tahiti and Moorea. This South Sea island sojourn was a backdrop to the novel Omoo (1847). After three years away from home, Melville joined up with a U.S. naval frigate that was returning to the eastern United States around Cape Horn.The novel White-Jacket(1850)describes this lengthy voyage as a navy 15 seaman. With the publication of these early adventure novels, Melville developed a strong and loyal following among readers eager for his tales of exotic places and situations. However, in 1851, with the publication of Moby Dick, Melville's popularity started to diminish. Moby Dick, on one level the saga of the hunt for the great white 20 whale, was also a heavily symbolic allegory of the heroic struggle of man against the universe. The public was not ready for Melville's literary metamorphosis from romantic adventure to philosophical symbolism. It is ironic that the novel that served to diminish Melville's popularity during his lifetime is the one for which he is best known today.",

He traveled extensively and used the knowledge gained during his travels as the basis for his early novels. In 1837, 5  at the age of eighteen, Melville signed as a cabin boy on a merchant ship that was to sail from his Massachusetts home to Liverpool, England. His experiences on this trip served as a basis for the novel Redburn (1849). In 1841 Melville set out on a whaling ship headed for the South Seas. After jumping ship in Tahiti, he wandered around the 10 islands of Tahiti and Moorea. This South Sea island sojourn was a backdrop to the novel Omoo (1847). After three years away from home, Melville joined up with a U.S. naval frigate that was returning to the eastern United States around Cape Horn.The novel White-Jacket(1850)describes this lengthy voyage as a navy 15 seaman. With the publication of these early adventure novels, Melville developed a strong and loyal following among readers eager for his tales of exotic places and situations. However, in 1851, with the publication of Moby Dick, Melville's popularity started to diminish.

One egg yolk, in fact, contains a little more than two-thirds of the suggested daily cholesterol 5  limit. This knowledge has caused egg sales to plummet in recent years, which in turn has brought about the development of several alternatives to eating regular eggs. One alternative is to eat substitute eggs. These egg substitutes are not really eggs, but they look somewhat like eggs when they are cooked. They have the advantage of having 10 lower cholesterol rates, and they can be scrambled or used in baking. One disadvantage, however, is that they are not good for frying, poaching, or boiling. A second alternative to regular eggs is a new type of egg, sometimes called \"designer\" eggs. These eggs are produced by hens that are fed low-fat diets consisting of ingredients such 15 as canola oil, flax, and rice bran. In spite of their diets, however, these hens produce eggs that contain the same amount of cholesterol as regular eggs. Yet, the producers of these eggs claim that eating their eggs will not raise the blood cholesterol in humans. 20 Egg producers claim that their product has been portrayed unfairly. They cite scientific studies to back up their claim. And, in fact, studies on the relationship between eggs and human cholesterol levels have brought mixed results. It may be that it is not the type of egg that is the main determinant of cholesterol but the person who 25 is eating the eggs. Some people may be more sensitive to cholesterol derived from food than other people. In fact, there is evidence that certain dietary fats stimulate the body's production of blood cholesterol. Consequently, while it still makes sense to limit one's intake of eggs, even designer eggs, it seems that doing this without regulating 30 dietary fat will probably not help reduce the blood cholesterol level.",

But what is in fact the difference between eating donuts 5  and smoking cigarettes? It is one of possible obesity or possible death.In the U.S. about 400,000 deaths a year can be attributed to cigarette smoking. Cigarette makers insist that there is no proof that heart 10 disease, even lung cancer, or any other disease, is actually caused by cigarettes. They deny adding nicotine to cigarettes; they even deny nicotine is addictive. They say that if it was, how could 40 million Americans have given up smoking in the last 20 years. They compare it to coffee drinking and ask if coffee manufacturers are 15 accused of adding caffeine to their coffee.Whatever the facts are, there is no doubt however that cigarette manufacturers do try to entice young people, even in their teens, to smoke, by advertisements and promotions that create an image even more addictive 20 than the nicotine in cigarettes.",

The two most common methods of distillation are fractional distillation, used in the preparation of alcoholic beverages, and flash distillation, used for the conversion 5  of ocean water to fresh water. In fractional distillation a mixtureis separated into its various component parts by boiling. This method makes use of the fact that different elements boil at varying temperatures. For example, alcohol has a considerably lower boiling temperature than water: the boiling temperature of water is 212 degrees and the 10 boiling temperature of alcohol is 172 degrees. Thus, when a mixture of alcohol and water is heated, the alcohol vaporizes more quickly than the water. The distillate is collected and the process is repeated until the desired purity has been achieved. Flash distillation does not require high temperatures but instead is based on pressure.

But Boone already exemplified the pioneer at his best. He was neither the physical 5  giant (five feet nine) nor the innocent child of nature that legend has made of him. He was an intelligent, soft spoken family man who cherished the same wife for 57 years. He befriended Indians, preferred company to solitude, and when he told his wife it was time to move because a newcomer had settled some 70 miles away, he was joking. 10 Pennsylvania-born, Boone was one of 11 children in a family of Quakers who migrated to North Carolina. There Boone was recruited at age 40 to undertake a scheme designed to open up Kentucky to settlers and establish it as a 14th colony. He arranged a deal by which the 15 Cherokees sold 20 million acres for $20,000 worth of goods to Boone's employers, the Transylvania Company. It was all fair and square-the Indians had an attorney, an interpreter, and the sound advice of their squaws. The deal completed, Boone led a party from Tennessee through the Cumberland Gap, hacked out the Wilderness Road, and set 20 up a town- Boonesboro-and a government. Elected a legislator, he introduced on the first session's first day a bill to protect game against wanton slaughter and a second bill to \"improve the breed of horses.\" He got 2,000 acres for his work, but after the Revolution-in which Boone won considerable fame as a militia commander-the scheme 25 of the Transylvania Company was declared illegal and Boone lost his land. Undaunted, he staked out more claims-and lost them because he impatiently neglected to register his deeds. Ever hopeful, he accepted an invitation from Spanish-held Missouri to come and settle there and bring others with him. The Spanish gave him 8,500 acres 30 and made him a judge.

        "content": "The First Amendment to the American Constitution declares freedom of the press to all men. Although this right was not officially adopted until 1791, the famous Zenger trial of 1735 laid the ground work for insuring this precious freedom.5 John Peter Zenger emigrated as a teenager from Germany. In 1733 he began publishing the New York Weekly Journal, The following year, he was arrested for writing a story about the crown-appointed governor of New York. While he was imprisoned for nine months, Zenger's wife 10 dutifully published the newspaper every day, bravely telling the truth about the corrupt government officials sent by the king to govern the colonies. Finally Zenger's long-awaited trial took place. The hostile judge 15 dismissed Zenger's local lawyers, making it necessary for his wife to seek out Andrew Hamilton, a prominent Philadelphia lawyer. Persuaded By Hamilton, the jury bravely returned a not-guilty verdict defying the judge's orders for a convection. 20 As a result of determination and bravery on the part of the colonists, a lasting victory for freedom of the press was set by a young immigrant.",

        "content": "There are many theories of aging, but virtually all fall into the category of being hypotheses with a minimum of supporting evidence. One viewpoint is that aging occurs as the body's organ systems become less efficient. Thus failures in the immune system, hormonal system, 5  and nervous system could all produce characteristics that we associate with aging. Following a different vein, many current researchers are looking for evidence at the cellular and sub cellular level. It has been shown that cells such as human fibroblasts (generalized tissue cells) grown in culture divide only a limited number of times 10 and then die. (Only cancer cells seem immortal in this respect.) Fibroblast cells from an embryo divide more times than those taken from an adult. Thus some researchers believe that aging occurs at the cellular level and is part of the cell's genetic makeup. Any event that disturbs the cell's genetic machinery such as mutation, 15 damaging chemicals in the cell's environment, or loss of genetic material, could cause cells to lose their ability to divide and thus bring on aging. Other theories of aging look at different processes. Chronological aging refers to the passage of time since birth and 20 is usually measured in years. While chronological age can be useful in estimating the average status of a large group of people, it is a poor indicator of an individual person's status because there is a tremendous amount of variation from one individual to the next in regard to the rate at which biological age changes occur. For 25 example, on the average, aging results in people losing much of their ability to perform strenuous activities, yet some elderly individuals are excellent marathon runners. Another type of aging is cosmetic aging, which consists of changes 30 in outward appearance with advancing age. This includes changes in the body and changes in other aspects of a person's appearance, such as the style of hair and clothing, the type of eyeglasses, and the use of a hearing aid. Like chronological aging, it is frequently used to estimate the degree to which other types of aging have occurred. 35 However, it is an inaccurate indicator for either purpose because of variation among individuals and because a person's appearance is affected by many factors that are not part of aging, including illness, poor nutrition, and exposure to sunlight.",

It was so superior to anything else on the seas that it was dubbed \"unsinkable\". So sure of this were the owners that they provided lifeboats for only 950 of its 5  possible 3.500 passengers. Many passengers were aboard the night it rammed an iceberg, only two days at sea and more than half way between England and the New York destination. Because the luxury liner was traveling so fast, it was 10 impossible to avoid the ghostly looking iceberg. An unextinguished fire also contributed to the ship's submersion.

Saving played an important role in the European tradition; it contributed to Americans' motivation to put something aside today for the tools to buy tomorrow.20 The great bulk of the accumulated wealth of America, as distinguished from that which was consumed, was derived either directly or indirectly from trade. Though some manufacturing existed, its role in the accumulation of capital was negligible. A merchant class of opulent proportions 25 was already visible in the seaboard cities, its wealth the obvious consequence of shrewd and resourceful management of the carrying trade. Even the rich planters of tidewater Virginia and the rice coast of South Carolina finally depended for their genteel way of life upon the ships and merchants who sold their tobacco and rice 30 in the markets of Europe.

After she succeeded with the newspaper software system, she hired several bright computer-science graduates to develop additional programs. When these were marketed and sold, ASK began to grow. It now has 200 employees, 30 and Sandra Kurtzig owns $66.9 million of stock. Of course, many women who start their own businesses fail, just as men often do. They still face hurdles in the business world, especially problems in raising money; the banking and finance world is still 35 dominated by men, and old attitudes die hard.

It has received considerable attention in recent years when increased pressure for energy conservation has. accentuated the need for more efficient methods of processing the bovine carcass. Cooling of an 5  entire carcass requires a considerable amount of refrigerated space, since bone and trimmable fat are cooled along with the muscle. It is also necessary to space the carcasses adequately in the refrigerated room for better air movement and prevention of microbial contamination, thus adding to the volume requirements for carcass chillers.10 Conventional handling of meat involves holding the beef sides in the cooler for 24 to 36 hours before boning. Chilling in the traditional fashion is also associated with a loss of carcass weight ranging from 2% to 4% due to evaporation of moisture from the meat tissue.15 Early excision, or hot boning, of muscle prerigor followed by vacuum packaging has several potential advantages. By removing only the edible muscle and fat prerigor, refrigeration space and costs are minimized, boning labor is decreased and storage yields increased.20 Because hot boning often results in toughening of meat, a more recent approach, hot boning following electrical stimulation, has been used to reduce the necessary time of rigor mortis. Some researchers have found this method beneficial in maintaining tender meat, while others have found that the meat also becomes tough after electrical stimulation.",

It was during the time of Madame von Meck's patronage,  however, that Tchaikovsky created the music for which he is most  famous, including the music for the ballets of Swan Lake and The  Sleeping Beauty. Tchaikovsky's music, well known for its rich melodic  and sometimes melancholy passages, was one of the first that brought  15 serious dramatic music to dance. Before this, little attention had  been given  to the music behind the dance. Tchaikovsky died on November  6, 1893, ostensibly of cholera, though there are now some scholars  who argue that he committed suicide.",

        "content": "The cause of tooth decay is acid, which is produced by bacteria in the mouth. The acid removes minerals from tooth enamel, allowing tooth decay to begin; the saliva in your mouth encourages remineralization and neutralizes the acid. The rate at which bacteria in the mouth 5  produce acid depends on the amount of plaque on the teeth, the composition of the microbial flora, and whether the bacteria of the plaque have been \"primed\" by frequent exposure to sugar. To keep your teeth healthy, a regular dental hygiene program should be followed. 10 Removing plaque with a toothbrush and dental floss temporarily reduces the numbers of bacteria in the mouth and thus reduces tooth decay. It also makes the surfaces of the teeth more accessible, enabling saliva to neutralize acid and remineralize lesions. If fluoride is present in drinking water when teeth are forming, some fluoride is 15 incorporated into the enamel of the teeth, making them more resistant to attack by acid. Fluoride toothpaste seems to act in another way, by promoting the remineralization of early carious lesions. In addition to a regular dental hygiene program, a good way to keep 20 your teeth healthy is to reduce your intake of sweet food. The least cavity-causing way to eat sweets is to have them with meals and not between. The number of times you eat sweets rather than the total amount determines how much harmful acid the bacteria in your saliva produce. But the amount of sweets influences the quality of your 25 saliva. Avoid, if you can, sticky sweets that stay in your mouth a long time. Also try to brush and floss your teeth after eating sugary foods. Even rinsing your mouth with water is effective. Whenever possible, eat foods with fiber, such as raw carrot sticks, apples, celery sticks, etc., that scrape off plaque, acting as a toothbrush. 30 Cavities can be greatly reduced if these rules are followed when eating sweets.",
